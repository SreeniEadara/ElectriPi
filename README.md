# ElectriPi
A power supply shield for the Raspberry Pi. Capable of up to 50W (5V, 10A).

## Features
- Indicator LEDs for power in and power out
- 4040 cooling fan compatibility (fan voltage is selectable)
- Input reverse polarity protection
- Input protected by user-replacable fuse
- Input & output transient protection
- Switching frequency nominally out of audible range (no power supply whine under light loads)
- Raspberry Pi protected by ideal diode
- Auxillary 5V output

## Capabilities (predicted from component selection)
- High output current (max 10A, sum of both outputs)
- Wide input range (7V - 24V)

TO BE TESTED:
- Max/min input range
- Max output current
- Protection performance
- Operating temperatures
- Output ripple and load response
- Efficiency

*Once these have been tested, I'll prepare an appropriate datasheet.*


NOTE: Device is, as of writing (Feb 2024), in the prototype phase. Details are SUBJECT TO CHANGE and specified performance characteristics are PRELIMINARY AND UNTESTED.
