# ElectriPi
A power supply shield for the Raspberry Pi. Capable of supplying up to 27.5W to the Raspberry Pi and 50W total including auxiliary output.

## Features
- Indicator LEDs for power in and power out
- 4040 cooling fan compatibility (fan voltage is selectable)
- Input reverse polarity protection
- Input protected by user-replacable fuse
- Input & output transient protection
- Switching frequency nominally out of audible range (no power supply whine under light loads)
- Raspberry Pi protected by ideal diode
- Auxillary 5V output

## Capabilities (predicted from component selection)
- Capable of powering all current RPi models with high current peripherals (27.5W max supplied to the Pi)
- High maximum auxiliary output power (22.5W or greater, depends on remainder of 50W total not consumed by RPi)
- Wide input range (7V - 24V)

TO BE TESTED:
- Max/min input range
- Max output current
- Protection performance
- Operating temperatures
- Output ripple and load response
- Efficiency

*Once these have been tested, I'll prepare an appropriate datasheet.*


NOTE: Device is, as of writing (Feb 2024), in the prototype phase. Details are SUBJECT TO CHANGE and specified performance characteristics are PRELIMINARY AND UNTESTED.
